### OVERVIEW

sMockin is a tool used to build dynamic mocks of your API.

Featuring a rich UI and inbuilt mock servers, mocking your existing or new API model can be done quickly and without any coding or scripting.

Whether you are a developer who needs to simulate RESTFul endpoints or an engineer working with complex SOA/IoT/microservice infrastructure, sMockin can help by mimicking any services that are either unavailable or otherwise too difficult or time consuming to set up.

sMockin runs as a small web app which can be either installed locally to a developers machine or hosted centrally with mutliple user accounts on a development / QA team server.

### ABOUT

sMockin is designed and actively maintained by MG Tech Software Ltd.

Why the name sMockin? Whilst it may sound like an old english middle ages embroidery technique, the name actually came about more in relation to a classic Jim Carey movie quote 'Smokin'. We then added the extra letter to play on the concept of software mocking and there you have it. 

Yes, way too much thought went into that...
