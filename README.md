WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.6

    IMPORT & EXPORT MOCKS

        A single installation of sMockin can now be used across your development and QA teams
        with the introduction of user accounts. Each user can create and manage their own mocks
        which are served from their own unique context path. User's can also view, copy and access each
        others mock definitions.

        Please see the 'MULTI USER SUPPORT' section below for further details on how to enable
        this feature.



OVERVIEW

    sMockin is a framework with a rich UI used for setting up API simulations and mocks in a bid to aid 
    development and QA testing in the ever growing realm of the 'Internet of Things'.

    Whether you are a mobile developer who needs to simulate RESTFul endpoints or an engineer working
    with complex SOA/IoT/microservice infrastructure, sMockin can help by mimicking any services that 
    would be otherwise too difficult or time consuming to set up.

    With the ability to vary content using easy to set up sequences and rules, sMockin can help
    simulate all of your use case scenarios.

    sMockin runs as a small web app which can be either installed locally to a developers machine 
    or hosted centrally with mutliple user accounts on a development / QA team server.

ABOUT

    sMockin is designed and actively maintained by MG Tech Software Ltd.

    Why the name sMockin? Whilst it may sound like an old english middle ages embroidery technique, the name
    actually came about more in relation to a classic Jim Carey movie quote 'Smokin'. We then added the extra
    letter to play on the concept of software mocking and there you have it. 
    
    Yes, way too much thought went into that...
